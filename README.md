Cobol to Avro Converter accepts the Cobol Copybook and converts it into the Avro schema. Generated Avro schema
is used to convert the records in the Cobol data file into Apache Avro format.

Usage Notes
-----------

The plugin accepts a Cobol Copybook as a configuration to generate an Avro schema and use that schema to convert
records into Avro format. Code in the Copybook can be pasted in the "Copybook" property. Avro schema corresponding to
the Copybook can be retrieved using the "Get Schema" button. "Code Format" property is used to specify the code format
in the Copybook, which can either be FIXED_FORMAT or FREE_FORMAT. Charset used to read the data can be specified using
"Charset" property, which defaults to "IBM01140". Cobol data file can contain variable-length logical records, in which case
record consists of a record descriptor word (RDW) followed by the data. Plugin can be configured to use with
variable-length records by setting property "Records start with Record Descriptor Word" to true.

Cobol to Avro Converter is usually used with the WholeFileReader source plugin. WholeFileReader reads the entire data file and pass it
to the converter as an array of bytes. Name of the field containing Cobol records as an array of bytes can be configured.
